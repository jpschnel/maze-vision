  {ubit: jrcharlo, progress: updated shortest path algo to output the path in a form that florence can understand}
  {ubit: nwhahn, progress: image processing improvements}
  {ubit: jpschnel, progress: algorithm research}
  {ubit: murphy53, progress: edge case testing}
  ]
issues: [ 
  {ubit: jpschnel, issue: need new shortest path algo because Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is inherently too expensive even with attempted optimization.}
